This project provides solution to various java programming interview questions. There is an interactive applet (com.test.ProblemApplet ) that shows all the questions. Select one of the question in the applet to run it. In order to compile and run the project, use the following commands:

Algo>cd src
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/test/ProblemApplet.java 
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/questions/*/*.java
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/questions/tree/bst/*.java
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/questions/linkedlist/single/*.java
src>cd ..
Algo>java -cp bin com.test.ProblemApplet

Write a code to determine if a linkedList is a pallidrome

You are given two numbers in the form of linked list.Add them without reversing the linked lists. linked lists can be of any length.
Ex:123 1->2->3
10234 1->0->2->3->4
