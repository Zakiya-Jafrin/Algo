ALGO - Java Data Structures and Algorithms
#======================================
This project provides solution to various java programming interview questions. There is an interactive applet (com.test.ProblemApplet ) that shows all the questions. Select one of the question in the applet to run it. In order to compile and run the project, use the following commands:

Algo>cd src
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/test/ProblemApplet.java 
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/questions/*/*.java
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/questions/tree/bst/*.java
src>javac -d ../bin/ com/questions/linkedlist/single/*.java
src>cd ..
Algo>java -cp bin com.test.ProblemApplet

Questions Remaining:
1. Sort a link list using merge sort.
2. Find 3rd largest element in an array 
3. There is a linked list whose node has 3 fields, val, next pointer & random pointer...next 
pointer points to next node in the list and random pointer can point to any node in the list.
Write an efficient function which takes such list and returns the copy/clone of that list.

Data Structures Complexity: 
Benefit of linkedlist over array:
  * you don't need continuous space
  * you don't need to predefined space
  * efficiently utlization of space because you don't block any more space than currently required. 
  
  
Benefits/Issues of single linked list and double linked list -- think of applications ?
